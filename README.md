# Quantum Error Correction: Surface Code

The repository implements surface code for quantum error correction and benchmarks the results of noisy simulation of 3 well known quantum algorithms in Q Sharp.

We also present a surface code generator by specifying the noise levels & thresholds.

# Plan
- Implement a surface code circuit builder with noise
- Implement a python pipline
- Implement three algorithms and benchmark the results of simulation with and without QEC for: Different code distance, different errors, different 
- Explore the relationship between physical noise levels set in the simulator and noise levels of the logical qubits encoded using surface code.
- Develop a UI for interation
